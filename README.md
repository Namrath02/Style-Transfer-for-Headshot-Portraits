# Style-Transfer-for-Headshot-Portraits
Digital Image Processing project

- We transfer the styles from the example portraits in the insets in (b) to the input in (a). Our transfer technique is local and multi-scale, and tailored for headshot portraits. First, we establish a dense correspondence between the input and the example. Then, we match the local statistics in all different scales to create the output.
  - Utilises OpenCV, GrabCut-CNN , SkImage , NumPy to process the Images in Python.
